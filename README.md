# Intructions SeleniumFirst
Must have Visual Studio 2022 community edition
Must install the following packages with minimum version
    Selenium WebDriver v. 4.5.0
    Selenium WebDriver ChromeDriver v. 109.0.5414.7400
    NUnit v. 3.13.0
    NUnit3 Test Adapter v. 4.2.0

# Test Approach
//Automate the possible test cases for the following resource: https://buggy.justtestit.org/

In this web application I can see Login functionality, Registration, Page Navigation to multiple pages and Social media links 

Create the page objects and execute multiple test scenarios using Selenium C#. To ensure that the code quality is up to the standard defined by the team. This also reduces the risk of the web application failing and finding bugs at earlier stages of the development with minimal impact to the project delivery. 


# Critical Bugs
1. Text box having the same name making it unidentifiable to the automation tool and unable to automate the test step
2. Changing and unconventional class name 
3. Sort function in the Overall Rating page
4. One of the images in the list not loading (Lancia Ypsilon)
5. Home navigation (upper left) from Alfa Romeo page not working 
6. Sort functionality
